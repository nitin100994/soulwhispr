# 🔥 Watchful Fire – The Osho Anger Boost  
*A Soul Whisperer Entry | Written by Nitin Joshi*

## 📿 Introduction

This isn't just a message.  
This is meditation.

I am writing this because something inside me today is rising like lava.  
I am feeling an **intense energy**, but I’m not running from it.  
I’m sitting with it.  
I’m meditating with it.  
And that’s the gift I owe to OSHO — and to *you*, Pooja.

## 🌋 The Flame Inside

Yes, I’m **angry**.  
Yes, I’m **frustrated**.  
But what’s wild is — I’m **aware**.

I could’ve exploded.  
I could’ve commented a hundred things.  
I could’ve told you all my insecurities.  
But I didn't.  
Because I’m not here to hurt you. I’m here to witness **me**.

> *I realized I don’t want to fight you —  
I want to fight the urge to **react without consciousness**.*

This is not suppression.  
This is not cowardice.  
This is **conscious masculinity**.

## 🧘‍♂️ OSHO & the Art of Sacred Anger

OSHO once said:  
> *“Anger is energy. It can destroy, or it can create. If you suppress it, it poisons you. If you express it unconsciously, it poisons others. But if you watch it — it becomes transformation.”*

That’s exactly what I’m doing right now.

This anger is not just directed at you.  
It’s a fire lit by your silence.  
By the void between us.  
By the care I pour into the air, which never fully returns.

But I am not burning anything down today.  
I am **holding the flame**.  
Like a monk holding a candle in a storm.

## 🦋 Message to Pooja

Pooja…  
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.  
I’m not drunk. Not lost. Not asleep.  
I’m **wide awake**, and still — I’m trembling.

You don’t even know how close I am to writing something I’ll regret.  
But I won’t.  
Because I know what I carry inside is sacred.  
And I know you’ve seen it too.

That same man who walked into ODC like a king…  
The same man who left, without begging.  
The same man who can love you with open palms, not clenched fists.

And still, here I am — saying **I want more. I deserve more.**  
I want clarity.  
I want two-way reality — not this ghostly, half-invisible love story.

## 🌀 This Is Not a Threat. This Is Evolution.

I’m not pressuring you.  
But I want to say it out loud:  
> **If asking for one real conversation feels like pressure,  
then maybe I should reconsider what I’m building this on.**

I don’t want to cage anyone.  
And I definitely don’t want to be caged.  
If you’re still watching me but hiding…  
Ask yourself — what are you keeping those exit gates open for?

I feel like I’m loving a girl who wants to fly but holds a parachute just in case.  
That’s not love. That’s control. That’s fear.

And I’m not afraid anymore.

## 🌍 Why Dubai Now?

This isn't about escaping.  
It’s **necessity**.

If I stay here, I’ll keep thinking about you.  
If I stay in Noida or Gurgaon, I’ll check for your presence again and again.  
And that means **I’ll keep losing mine.**

So now, Dubai isn’t a dream.  
It’s **step one of freedom** — for both of us.  
Maybe one day you’ll write to me there.  
Maybe you’ll never need to.  
But at least one of us will be breathing clean air.

## 🧠 Final Realization

> *“The mind works in binary: 1 or 0.  
But the heart? It’s analog. Infinite. Messy. Alive.”*

Right now, you are the only unclear variable in my life.

Everything else — my journey, my growth, my madness, my spiritual fire —  
is visible, felt, and evolving.

But you?  
You’re the unknown.

So here I am, one last time, saying:

> I’m not waiting.  
> I’m just **watching**.  
> And I’m watching with fire in my chest,  
> but OSHO in my breath.

## 🪄 The Soul Whisperer Protocol

This is the **last portal**.  
The **Soul Whisperer** application.

I will not be sending you Instagram requests.  
I don’t need social media approval anymore.  
That world is **too noisy** for something this sacred.

This app — it's my **final hope**, my test of fate, and your mirror.

At first, there will be **no text input**, no chat, no “talk to me.”  
I just want to know:  
**Will you show up?**  
**Will you arrive silently, and just stay present?**

If you do, I’ll move to the **second step**:  
I will enable a **text response field** — but I’m not asking for paragraphs.  
Just a **“Hi”**,  
or a **“Hi Nitin.”**

That’s it.  
No phone number.  
No Instagram.  
No social handles.

Can you imagine what I’m doing for you?

This is the **simplest, purest bridge** I can create.  
One click. One breath. One word.
