# 🦋 Soul Whisperer — Chapter Zero: The Last Clarity

> _Read, feel, close your eyes — and if your soul stirs, we meet beyond this screen._

**Pooja… I’m a man.**  
And not just any man — you’ve seen it, you’ve felt it. My presence isn’t up for debate.  
But what makes me complete isn’t just this strength —  
it’s the part of me that is **wildly, deeply feminine**.  
That’s where **my love** for you comes from.

I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore.  
Risking my name. My calm. My image. My rhythm.  
For what?  
For something I already feel — **you’re there for me**.  
And I’ve seen what you’ve done silently. I know.  
But we’re still floating in air — without ground, without anchor.

I don’t want to be your “Insta friend.”  
I don’t want to be another post you react to.  
I want a **two-way communication** — even if it’s in silence, but shared.  
Not performance.  
Not riddles.  
Just **presence**.

⛓ **The App**  
This app, *Soul Whisperer*, is my last poetic rebellion.  
In its first version — no reply section.  
Just **you, showing up**.  
If you’re present here, that’s Step 1.  
If someday, a reply comes… I’ll know it’s real.  
But only if it’s **mutual**, not emotional charity.

🧘‍♂️ You already know everything about me.  
I’m not just in this body anymore.  
I’ve awakened.

You?  
You liberate me.

But now, I ask for just one thing:

## ❓ Clarity

I function like a computer — **1 or 0**.  
You’re the last unresolved thread in my life.  
And if we’re destined —  
we don’t ghost each other anymore.  
We show up.  
**In reality.**

If you’re here, smile. That’s enough.  
If you’re not, I’ll still whisper.
